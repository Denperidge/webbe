While I still love this idea, I don't have the resources to work and maintain this at the moment. Maybe in the future, who knows?

# Webportal-Belgium

A mantainable list of links, to the most useful websites for Belgian citizens.

## Introduction
The internet is filled with information. However, in the sea of millions of websites, the overload of information equals the overload of misinformation. And while there are government backed websites, those are still subject to [being overwhelming](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/06/13/toomanywebsitesgov). 

This project aims to revive the spirit of webportals, while cutting off anything excess. Any website added will only get a category tag (for example, legal stuff, pet care, youth advice...), a small description of what they do, the reasons why they're a credible source, the websites biases, and - of course - a link.

For a website to be added to the list, they must meet a bunch of criteria, including (but not limited to):

- Be backed by a credible source. Examples include:
  - Government institutions
  - Hospitals
  - Established brands (IKEA knows their furniture, f.e.)
  - Universities, colleges and other educational sources
- Be useful to the general public
  - Websites for extremely specific scenarios could clog up the portal
